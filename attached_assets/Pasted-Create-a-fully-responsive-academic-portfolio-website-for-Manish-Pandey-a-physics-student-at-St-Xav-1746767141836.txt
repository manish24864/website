Create a fully responsive academic portfolio website for Manish Pandey, a physics student at St. Xavier's College, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Use HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript or React (optional). The design should be clean, minimal, and professional for scientific use. Implement the following:

🧑‍🎓 Header & Navigation
Include name: Manish Pandey

Subheading: Physics Student

Menu: Home, About, Publications, Projects, Workshops, Blog, Contact

Sticky header with smooth scrolling

🖼️ Hero Section
Add a cropped and edited personal photo of Manish

Add introduction:

Aspiring theoretical physicist with interests in quantum mechanics, computational physics, and space science at St. Xavier's College, Nepal.

Add buttons: Contact Me, Learn More

📖 About Section
Title: About Me

Text: Short bio on passion for theoretical physics, space science, computational physics

Education:

BSc in Physics – St. Xavier's College (2022–Present)

High School (Science Stream) – Radiant Secondary School (2019–2021)

Research Interests:

Add Download CV button (note: the button works but downloaded PDF is corrupt — investigate MIME or file error)

📚 Publications
Show only one journal article (Pandey et al., 2024, DBD Micro-Discharges)

Buttons: PDF, arXiv, Peer-reviewed

Remove placeholder conference paper

🚀 Projects Section
Use cards or project blocks with title, image, description, and tech stack

Include:

CubeSat Design and Telemetry System

GNSS-Based Traffic Congestion Analysis

Saumya Quake → use saumya.png

Vāyu → use vayu.png

Remove Plasma Driver Development and any dummy projects

🧪 Workshops & Colloquia
Each workshop block must have:

Title, short description, location, date, participation type

Alternating left/right image layout (desktop); stacked on mobile

Button: View Certificate (ensure "V" is not cut off — fix with padding or spacing)

Use images:

Basics of Quantum ESPRESSO → quantum_espresso_logo.png

GNSS Workshop → gnss.png

CubeSat Training → cube.jpg

Experimental Plasma Physics → plasma.png

Quantum Computing → quantum_computing.png

📝 Blog Section
Show 3 cards with:

Title

Date

Keywords (e.g. “Plasma Physics”, “Quantum Computing”)

Text: Coming Soon

Button: Read more

Add View All Posts link

📬 Contact Section
Title: Contact Me

Text: invitation for collaborations and inquiries

Email: manish.phy.math@gmail.com

Address: St. Xavier’s College, TU, Kathmandu

Availability: Weekdays, 3–5 PM

Add working Contact Form (Name, Email, Message) and comment: “stored securely in database”

Add links to academic profiles (Google Scholar, ORCID, GitHub if available)

✅ General Improvements
Ensure mobile responsiveness:

Fix long text overflow on small screens

Stack workshop cards vertically on mobile

Make buttons and text scale appropriately

Use accessible markup and Tailwind for layout

Clean footer:
